# rename-machine-macos-linux
Rename your files from a specified directory if there are numbers, full stops and spaces before them that you would like to remove. Only works on MacOS and linux (requires Bash terminal).
# **How to use**
Download the file **rename.sh** by opening it, and clicking the download icon in the top rights corner.
Open Terminal. type 'cd' followed by the path (all files in that path with numbers, periods, and spaces before them will will have those removed).
Then type './rename.sh' (without the quotation marks). Terminal should tell you which files it is renaming.
After Terminal finishes, all files have been renamed.
